SAM'S ULTIMATE PIC LIBRARIES (SUPL)
------------------------------------

SUPL is a collection of libraries for the PIC series of microcontrollers. Its purpose is to make embedded system design with PIC MCUs simpler, more rapidly deployable, and extensible. The libraries are organized into logical folders, which will can be seen by cloning this project and opening it in the MPLABX IDE. The "Peripherals" folder contains low-level functions for initializing and accessing peripheral modules in the microcontroller, and the "Drivers" folder provides interfaces to commonly-used chips, with function calls to the peripheral modules.
